# TVCG2025-TaskFree_PointCloudEyeTracking
## Overview

This repository contains the source code for IEEE TVCG (IEEE VR 2025) paper "Comparison of Visual Saliency for Dynamic Point Clouds: Task-free vs. Task-dependent".

Code clean up is still under way. If you want to replicate this study, please refer to our previous work: [Task-Dependent PointCloud EyeTracking](https://github.com/cwi-dis/ISMAR_PointCloud_EyeTracking).

The raw data of the gaze and visual saliency map will be updataed before IEEE VR 2025.
